# Weighted Gene-Level Meta-Analysis

<!-- Don't use 'integrating' since integrative is emotive for biologists
     -->
<!-- Don't use 'aggregating' to describe the process of combining results since
     we refer to aggregate statistics (from an individual dataset)
     -->

Meta-analysis is a powerful tool for combining scientific results across
multiple studies. For example, through meta-analysis of several, related,
gene-expression studies we can gain greater confidence in the association (or
response) of a gene with an experimental treatment or disease-state.

Several `R` packages already exist for performing meta-analysis, either on the
summary statistics from published experiments (effect-sizes, p-values,
z-scores; aggregate-level meta-analysis) or through re-analysis of the original
datasets (individual-level meta-analysis).

[List some example R packages; biased towards gene-expression tools]

[Use of aggregated-data vs individual-level data: Is there much benefit in the
latter?]

[Limited applicability of some meta-analysis approaches for gene-expression
studies or for complicated experimental designs: how to deal with
cross-platform effects, gene-missingness, low-quality datasets]
